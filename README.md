This repo contains three files  
- run_analysis.R  
- CodeBook.md and  
- README.md, this readme file  

The _run_analysis.R_ file generates a data set of mean values of measurements
of mean and standard deviations after grouping by subject and activities.  
The _CodeBook.md_ describes the data frame, the variables, the data values and
work done to obtain the data frame.
The above two files and this _README.md_ file reside in the **PeerProject**
repo.
